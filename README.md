*Note about control: 

- Hold left mouse button for holding objects
- To throw an object, press right click button, while holding left	
- You can move WASD and sprint with Shift
- Rewind time for most objects is a around 5 seconds, 
	meaning, you won't see much unless object was moving for last 5 seconds, so try first throw it

*Note on some confusing things:

- To open white doors you need a key card block (it is small and white): 
	- Insert the key card by holding it (with LMB) and simply walking towards the key scanner.
	- Stand right next to it if next step does not work try to come closer.
	- Now you should be able to click LBM to open the door or RMB to get the keycard back.

*Note on known bugs:
- You can soft lock yourself, if u do not open white door at level 2, but you open red one and then use rewind on generator.
